The repo is structured into 3 sections (listed below). Within each section, scripts are sequentially numbered in the order that they should be run in. Any data required to run scripts is called from the `data_in` folder, or the `output` folder if it is generated within the analysis. The expected output can be found in the `output` folder within each of the 3 folders listed below: 

Folder `1-segmented-sampling-validation`: contains the analysis for validating the segmented sampling method by revisiting the systematic review by Sherrard-Smith et al. (2019) <https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1820646116>

Folder `2-field-data`: analysing the data collected in the Bijagos archipelago in November 2023.

Folder `3-model-ITN-impact`: code for using the ICDMM model to predict the impact of ITNs in a Bijagos-like setting, using estimates of phi-Bed generated from field data.

The analysis is run using R version 4.4.1. Each script will be relatively quick to run. Note that `1-segmented-sampling-validation/2.ITN_impact_sampling_method.R`,  `2-field-data/2.sleeping_glmm.R`, `2-field-data/4.ento_glmm.R` and `3-model-ITN-impact/1.scenario_modelling_bijagos.R` will take slightly longer to run due to the run time of the statistical and mathematical models.

This version of the ICDMM R package is required to run the code. Please follow these installation instructions below (and for other packages required to run the analysis). These packages should take a few minutes to install. 

``` r
#need to install the ICDMM package (this version) 
install.packages( "odin", repos = c("https://mrc-ide.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org")) 
devtools::install_github("nilani-chandradeva1/odin-malaria-model")
#rstanarm and bayesplot will require a C++ toolchain, which can be installed by following the Stan installation guideline for R: https://mc-stan.org/rstan/
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggpattern", "scales", "hms", "rstanarm", "bayesplot", "lubridate", "sf", "sp"))
#ggpattern requires package "fastmap" version â‰¥ 1.2.0. If this is not installed automatically, ensure that it is: install_packages("fastmap", dependencies = TRUE)
remotes::install_github("r-tmap/map")

```
